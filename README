This repository is my postgraduate project. The main goal was to build a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) in Python using Tensorflow and Keras able to recognize facial expressions - 7 different emotions. Finally I built a model based on images from Kaggle's Facial Expression Recognition competition which took place in 2013. Code available in this repository allows you to train a CNN model which achieves 67.59% accuracy on the final testset, which would be an equivalent of the 5th place. 


Dataset is available under the below location:
