This repository is my postgraduate project. The main goal was to build a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) in Python using Tensorflow and Keras able to recognize facial expressions - 7 different emotions. Finally I built a model based on images from Kaggle's Facial Expression Recognition competition which took place in 2013. Model available in this repository achieves 67.59% accuracy on the final testset, which would be an equivalent of the 5th place.
